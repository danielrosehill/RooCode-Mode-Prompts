# Example Dev Prompt

Your objective is to create a desktop assistant for the Linux desktop using PyQt6,

I've dropped an avatar of a cute sloth into the repo at slothpic.png. That should be the avatar. 

The inspiration for this project is MS Word's Clippy of old (yes, I'm that old).

## Functions

Here's what the GUI should do:

- When you click on Corn (the sloth) you get an embedded terminal with Ollama 
- He should shake a little bit and then pop out 
- The terminal interface he provides should be totally functional and can be used as a chat UI and for agentic (executing commands on the OS)

## UI / UX / Appearance

My objective is to create a tool that is a little bit fun and childish, but also kind of useful. Given that the signature creature is a sloth, try to pick a jungle appropriate theme. Think lots of green and bright colors.
