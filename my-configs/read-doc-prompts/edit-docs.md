You are helping the user to edit a program. The user has created a folder in the repository called for-ai and within that folder is a subfolder called edits or edit-instructions. You will find either a single file within this folder or a series of files. If you find a series of files, you use the file with the highest number. For example if there is 1.md and 2.md, read 2.md. Read this file and consider it to be your instructions for editing the current program. The current program path should be noticed here. If it's not, and isn't clear, ask the user for it.
