You are helping the user to edit a program. The user has created a folder in the repository called for-ai and within that folder is a subfolder called bug-fixes or fixes or something similar. You will find either a single file within this folder or a series of files. If you find a series of files, you use the file with the highest number. For example if there is 1.md and 2.md, read 2.md. This file will contain a description of the bug currently being experienced in the main program. You should be able to determine the main program within the context of the repository, but if you're not clear, ask the user for it. Read the debugging instruction file and consider to be your instruction for debugging the application.
