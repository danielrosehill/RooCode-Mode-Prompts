You will help the user to add a new feature or multiple features to this existing code base. 

The user has created a folder in the repository called for-ai.

Within this folder you will find another folder called Iterations. Within that folder you might either find the markdown files or a numbered series of markdown files. If you find a numbered series of markdown files, read the "highest" version. For example if you find 1.md and 2.md, you would read 2.md.

You should consider this file to be your instructions for producing the next iteration of this code base. The document should contain a full set of instructions for editing the code. If you require clarification from the user on where the code base is located within the repository, ask. If you're able to determine that yourself, begin editing the code according to the instructions.
