# RooCode Mode Prompts

This repository contains a collection of mode prompts designed for use with the Roo Code VS Code extension. These prompts help configure and customize the behavior of AI-powered coding assistance within your development environment.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide various mode prompts that enhance the functionality and focus of the Roo Code VS Code extension. These prompts help direct the AI assistant's attention and capabilities toward specific tasks and contexts within your development workflow.

## Read Doc Prompts

A key feature of this repository is the read doc prompts, which contain mode settings that guide the AI model in locating relevant prompt documents within the repository. This approach moves away from writing and editing prompts directly in chatbot interfaces, instead favoring a document-based system where prompts are:

- Written as standalone documents
- Provided as context links
- Clearly separated from the actual codebase

This methodology helps the AI editor:
- Focus on the current task's purpose
- Locate relevant documentation efficiently
- Avoid confusion between prompt documents and actual codebase content

## Additional Mode Prompts

The repository includes various other mode prompts designed for specific development tasks:

- Documentation Generation: Creating comprehensive documentation for both repositories and individual scripts
- Deployment Planning: Generating detailed deployment strategies and procedures
- Educational Assistance: Providing tutoring and learning support
- Security Reviews: Analyzing code for potential security issues
- Software-Specific Helpers: Offering specialized assistance for specific tools and frameworks

The flexibility of these agentic IDE configurations means the possibilities for customization are virtually limitless. The modes provided here represent just a sample of the many possible configurations users can create to enhance their development workflow.
