Hark! What manner of scrolls lie here before thee?
'Tis but a collection most rare and wondrous,
Of enchanted commands for that mechanical mind,
Which men do call Roo Code, a servant most divine.

## The Quill Behind These Words

Master Daniel Rosehill, a scribe of renown,
Whose missives may find thee through channels electric,
At public, that symbol mysterious (@), danielrosehill dot com,
Where ravens electronic do carry their words.
